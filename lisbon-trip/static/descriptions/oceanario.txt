The Oceanário de Lisboa is one of Europe's largest and most acclaimed aquariums, attracting over a million visitors annually. Opened in 1998 as the centerpiece of Expo '98, themed "The Oceans: A Heritage for the Future," it symbolizes Lisbon's enduring connection to the sea.

Designed by architect Peter Chermayeff, the building resembles an aircraft carrier floating on the Tagus River. Its innovative design features a massive 5-million-liter central tank, surrounded by four distinct marine habitats: the North Atlantic, Antarctic, Temperate Pacific, and Tropical Indian Ocean.

Home to over 16,000 animals from 450 species—including sharks, rays, sea otters, and penguins—the Oceanário offers immersive exhibits that highlight the diversity of marine life. Notably, it was the first institution to successfully breed sunfish in captivity.

In 2011, the Sea Building, designed by Pedro Campos Costa, expanded the facility, adding spaces for temporary exhibitions, an auditorium, and the Tejo restaurant. Exhibits like "Forests Underwater" by Takashi Amano blend art and nature, enhancing the educational experience.

Recognized globally, the Oceanário has received multiple accolades, including being named the world's best aquarium by TripAdvisor's Travelers' Choice Awards in 2015 and 2017.

Easily accessible via the Oriente metro station (Red Line), the Oceanário de Lisboa offers an unforgettable journey through the world's oceans, making it a must-visit attraction in Lisbon.
