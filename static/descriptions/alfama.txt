Alfama, Lisbon's oldest district, is a captivating maze of narrow, cobbled streets that echo centuries of history. Nestled between São Jorge Castle and the Tagus River, Alfama's origins trace back to the Moorish era, evident in its labyrinthine layout and whitewashed buildings. Remarkably, it withstood the devastating 1755 earthquake, preserving its medieval charm.

This historic quarter is the birthplace of Fado, Portugal's soulful music genre, which resonates through local taverns and is celebrated at the Fado Museum. Landmarks like the Lisbon Cathedral (Sé de Lisboa) and the Church of Saint Anthony offer glimpses into the city's rich religious heritage. Alfama's vibrant culture is further showcased during the June festivals, where streets come alive with decorations, music, and traditional festivities.

Tram 28, an iconic yellow streetcar, offers a nostalgic journey through Alfama's steep hills and tight alleys. In operation since 1914, this vintage tram navigates past significant sites like the Sé Cathedral and Miradouro das Portas do Sol, providing panoramic views of the city. The tram's classic design, with polished wood interiors and brass fittings, adds to the charm of exploring Lisbon's historic neighborhoods.

Experiencing Alfama and Tram 28 immerses visitors in the authentic spirit of Lisbon, where history, culture, and daily life intertwine seamlessly.
