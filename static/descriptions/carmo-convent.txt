The Carmo Convent, or Convento da Ordem do Carmo, stands as a poignant testament to Lisbon's rich history and resilience. Founded in 1389 by Nuno Álvares Pereira, a revered military leader who later became a Carmelite friar, the convent was constructed in the Gothic style characteristic of mendicant religious orders. Its design features pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, reflecting the architectural influences of the period.

On November 1, 1755, a devastating earthquake struck Lisbon, causing the collapse of the convent's roof during All Saints' Day Mass. The disaster left the church in ruins, with its nave open to the sky—a haunting reminder of the catastrophe. Despite the destruction, the remaining arches and walls have been preserved, offering a glimpse into the grandeur of the original structure.

In the 19th century, the site was repurposed and eventually transformed into the Carmo Archaeological Museum. Today, visitors can explore a diverse collection of artifacts spanning various periods of Portuguese history, including Gothic tombs, Roman mosaics, and South American mummies. The museum's exhibits are housed within the ruins, creating a unique fusion of history and architecture.

The Carmo Convent not only serves as a cultural and historical landmark but also as a symbol of Lisbon's enduring spirit. Its open-air nave and preserved ruins offer a serene and reflective space amidst the bustling city, inviting visitors to connect with the past in a profound way.
