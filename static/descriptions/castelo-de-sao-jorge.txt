Perched atop Lisbon’s highest hill, Castelo de São Jorge is a storied fortress offering sweeping views over the city and the Tagus River. This iconic landmark traces its origins to the 11th century, when the Moors constructed it as a defensive stronghold. It was recaptured in 1147 by King Afonso Henriques during the Siege of Lisbon, a pivotal moment in the Christian Reconquista.

The castle's architecture reflects its diverse history, featuring Moorish foundations, medieval battlements, and remnants of the royal palace that once housed Portuguese monarchs until the 16th century. Notable features include the Tower of Ulysses, which houses a camera obscura offering a unique 360° view of Lisbon, and the archaeological site with vestiges from the Iron Age to the 18th century.

A legendary tale associated with the castle is that of Martim Moniz, a knight who, according to lore, sacrificed himself by blocking a gate with his body to ensure the Christian forces could enter during the siege.

Today, Castelo de São Jorge stands as a testament to Lisbon's rich tapestry of cultures and epochs, inviting visitors to explore its ancient walls, enjoy panoramic vistas, and delve into the city's multifaceted history.
