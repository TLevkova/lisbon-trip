Perched atop the Sintra Mountains, the Castelo dos Mouros is a medieval fortress offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Constructed during the 8th and 9th centuries by the Moors, it served as a strategic stronghold to protect the region and oversee trade routes. The castle's walls, built along the natural contours of the terrain, showcase the military architecture of the period.

In 1147, during the Christian Reconquista, the castle was surrendered to King Afonso I of Portugal. Subsequent centuries saw the addition of a chapel and various modifications, but the fortress gradually fell into disrepair. In the 19th century, King Ferdinand II initiated restoration efforts, preserving the ruins and integrating them into the romantic landscape of Sintra.

Today, visitors can explore the castle's ancient walls, towers, and the remnants of the chapel, all while enjoying sweeping views of Sintra and the Atlantic Ocean. The Castelo dos Mouros stands as a testament to the region's rich history and cultural heritage.
