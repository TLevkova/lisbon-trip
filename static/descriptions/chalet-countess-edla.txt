The Chalet and Garden of the Countess of Edla, nestled in the western reaches of Sintra's Pena Park, is a romantic retreat built between 1864 and 1869 by King Ferdinand II and his second wife, Elise Hensler, the Countess of Edla. Designed in the style of Alpine chalets popular in 19th-century Europe, the structure features painted plaster fa√ßades mimicking timber and extensive cork detailing on window frames, balconies, and decorative elements.

Surrounding the chalet is a lush garden showcasing a diverse collection of botanical species from around the world, including rare tree ferns from Australia and New Zealand. The landscape is thoughtfully designed with winding paths, tranquil lakes, and scenic viewpoints offering vistas of the sea, the Moorish Castle, and the Pena Palace.

After a devastating fire in 1999, the chalet underwent meticulous restoration and reopened to the public in 2011. Today, it stands as a testament to the enduring love story of Ferdinand and Elise, reflecting their shared passion for nature, art, and architecture.
