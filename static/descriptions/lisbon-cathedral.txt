Lisbon Cathedral, known as Sé de Lisboa, is the city's oldest church and a prominent symbol of its rich history and resilience. Construction began in 1147 after King Afonso Henriques recaptured Lisbon from the Moors. Built on the site of a former mosque, the cathedral was initially designed in the Romanesque style, characterized by its solid walls, rounded arches, and fortress-like façade flanked by two imposing towers.

Over the centuries, the cathedral has undergone numerous renovations due to natural disasters and evolving architectural tastes. The 1755 earthquake caused significant damage, leading to restorations that introduced Gothic and Baroque elements. Notable features include the Gothic cloister, the main chapel with its ribbed vaults, and the rose window that illuminates the nave. The cathedral also houses the tomb of King Afonso IV and relics of Saint Vincent of Saragossa, Lisbon's patron saint.

Today, Lisbon Cathedral stands as a testament to the city's layered past, blending various architectural styles that reflect its historical and cultural evolution. Its enduring presence in the Alfama district continues to captivate visitors and locals alike.
