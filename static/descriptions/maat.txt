The Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) is a contemporary cultural institution located along the Tagus River in Lisbon's Belém district. Opened in October 2016, MAAT is a project of the EDP Foundation and aims to explore the intersection of art, architecture, and technology.

The museum comprises two main buildings: the renovated Tejo Power Station, a notable example of early 20th-century industrial architecture, and a striking new structure designed by British architect Amanda Levete. The modern building features a flowing, wave-like form with a tiled façade that reflects light and water, creating a dynamic visual effect.

MAAT offers a diverse program of exhibitions and events, showcasing both national and international artists, architects, and thinkers. Its mission is to foster critical discourse and creative practice, encouraging new understandings of contemporary culture.

Visitors can explore a variety of spaces within the museum, including the Oval Gallery, the Main Gallery, the Video Room, and the Project Room. The rooftop terrace provides panoramic views of the river and the city, making MAAT not only a center for cultural engagement but also a landmark in Lisbon's urban landscape.
