Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of Lisbon’s most iconic viewpoints, perched above the historic Alfama district. Its name, meaning "Gates of the Sun," harks back to a medieval city gate lost in the 1755 earthquake. Today, it offers sweeping views over Alfama’s maze of terracotta rooftops, the shimmering Tagus River, and landmarks like the São Vicente de Fora Monastery and the National Pantheon.

The terrace is adorned with a statue of Saint Vincent, Lisbon’s patron saint, holding a boat with two ravens—symbols of the city’s coat of arms. Nearby, the 18th-century Azurara Palace houses the Decorative Arts Museum, adding a touch of aristocratic charm to the area. The viewpoint is also a cultural hotspot, often animated by street musicians and local artists, reflecting the vibrant spirit of Alfama.

Whether you're capturing the sunrise, enjoying a drink at a nearby café, or simply soaking in the atmosphere, Miradouro das Portas do Sol offers an unforgettable glimpse into Lisbon’s soul.
