Miradouro de Santa Luzia is one of Lisbon’s most enchanting viewpoints, perched above the Alfama district. This terrace offers sweeping views over Alfama’s terracotta rooftops, the Tagus River, and landmarks like the National Pantheon and São Miguel Church.

Adjacent to the viewpoint stands the Igreja de Santa Luzia, originally built in the 12th century and later reconstructed in the 18th century after the 1755 earthquake. The church's southern wall features two notable azulejo panels by António Quaresma, depicting the Praça do Comércio before the earthquake and the Christian conquest of Lisbon in 1147.

The terrace itself is adorned with bougainvillea-covered pergolas and traditional Portuguese tiles, creating a romantic and serene atmosphere. A bust of historian Júlio de Castilho graces the garden, which bears his name. The nearby Jardim Júlio de Castilho offers a peaceful retreat with its lush greenery and shaded benches.

Miradouro de Santa Luzia is not just a scenic spot but a place where history, art, and culture converge, offering visitors a glimpse into Lisbon's rich heritage and timeless beauty.
