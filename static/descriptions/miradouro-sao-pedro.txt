Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcântara is a scenic terrace located in Lisbon's Bairro Alto district, offering panoramic views of the city's historic center. From this vantage point, visitors can admire landmarks such as São Jorge Castle, the Baixa district, and the Tagus River. The viewpoint is part of a landscaped garden established in 1864, featuring terraced levels, decorative fountains, and statues of classical figures like Minerva and Ulysses. A tiled map installed in 1952 helps identify the visible monuments across the city.

The garden also includes a monument to Eduardo Coelho, founder of the Diário de Notícias newspaper, accompanied by a statue of a newsboy, reflecting the area's historical connection to the press. The site is accessible via the historic Glória Funicular, which has been operating since 1885, connecting the lower city to the Bairro Alto neighborhood.

Today, Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcântara serves as a popular gathering spot for both locals and tourists, offering a tranquil setting to enjoy Lisbon's architectural beauty and vibrant atmosphere.
