Standing tall in Lisbon’s Praça dos Restauradores, the Monumento dos Restauradores is a 30-meter obelisk commemorating Portugal’s restoration of independence from Spanish rule in 1640. Inaugurated in 1886, it honors the heroes of the Portuguese Restoration War (1640–1668), which ended 60 years of Habsburg domination and ushered in the House of Braganza.

Designed by António Tomás da Fonseca, the monument features two bronze allegorical figures: Independence, a winged male breaking chains, sculpted by Alberto Nunes; and Victory, a winged female holding a laurel wreath and palm, by Simões de Almeida. Inscriptions on the obelisk mark key battles and events from the war, including the decisive battles of Montijo, Ameixial, and Montes Claros.

Uniquely, the monument was funded through public subscription in both Portugal and Brazil, reflecting widespread national pride. It also served as the site where the new Portuguese republican flag was first officially hoisted on December 1, 1910, symbolizing a new era in the nation's history.

Surrounded by notable architecture like the Palácio Foz and the former Eden Theater, the Monumento dos Restauradores stands as a testament to Portugal’s enduring spirit and historical resilience.
