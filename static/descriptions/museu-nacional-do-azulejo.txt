The Museu Nacional do Azulejo, or National Tile Museum, is a unique institution in Lisbon dedicated to the art of azulejosâ€”decorative ceramic tiles that are a hallmark of Portuguese culture. Established in 1965 and housed in the former Convent of Madre de Deus, founded in 1509 by Queen Leonor, the museum offers a comprehensive journey through the history of tile-making in Portugal.

The museum's collection spans from the 15th century to contemporary times, showcasing the evolution of styles, techniques, and cultural influences. Highlights include the 23-meter-long "Great View of Lisbon," a panoramic tile panel depicting the city before the 1755 earthquake, and the "Nossa Senhora da Vida" altarpiece from 1580, considered one of the earliest masterpieces of tile art.

Visitors can explore the convent's architectural features, such as the Manueline cloister, the richly decorated church, and the Chapel of Saint Anthony, all adorned with intricate tilework and gilded wood carvings. The museum not only preserves these historical elements but also integrates them into its exhibition, providing an immersive experience that reflects the significance of azulejos in Portuguese art and architecture.

Through its extensive collection and historic setting, the Museu Nacional do Azulejo offers an engaging insight into a distinctive aspect of Portugal's cultural heritage, making it a must-visit for those interested in art, history, and design.
