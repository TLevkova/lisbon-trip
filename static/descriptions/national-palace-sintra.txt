The National Palace of Sintra, also known as Palácio da Vila, stands in the heart of Sintra and is distinguished by its iconic twin conical chimneys. Its origins trace back to the Moorish period, with the earliest references dating to the 10th century. Following the Christian Reconquista in 1147, the palace became a favored residence of Portuguese monarchs, serving as a royal retreat for centuries.

The palace showcases a harmonious blend of architectural styles, including Gothic, Manueline, Moorish, and Mudéjar influences. Notable features include the Swan Room (Sala dos Cisnes), adorned with painted swans symbolizing royal alliances, and the Magpie Room (Sala das Pegas), decorated with magpies holding scrolls inscribed with "Por Bem," reflecting courtly tales. The Coat of Arms Room (Sala dos Brasões) boasts a magnificent domed ceiling displaying the heraldic symbols of 72 noble families.

Throughout its history, the palace has witnessed significant events, such as the reception of news about the discovery of Brazil by King Manuel I and the imprisonment of King Afonso VI. Despite suffering damage during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the palace was restored and continued to be used by the royal family until the establishment of the Portuguese Republic in 1910. Today, it stands as a testament to Portugal's rich cultural heritage and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Cultural Landscape of Sintra.
