The Padrão dos Descobrimentos, or Monument to the Discoveries, stands prominently along the northern bank of the Tagus River in Lisbon's Belém district. Inaugurated in 1960, it commemorates the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's death, a central figure in Portugal's Age of Discoveries.

Designed by architect José Ângelo Cottinelli Telmo and sculptor Leopoldo de Almeida, the monument takes the form of a stylized caravel, symbolizing the ships used during the 15th and 16th centuries. At its prow stands Prince Henry, holding a model of a carrack, leading a procession of 32 notable figures from the era, including explorers like Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan, monarchs, cartographers, and artists. The only female figure represented is Queen Philippa of Lancaster, mother of Prince Henry.

Adjacent to the monument lies a large compass rose and world map, a 50-meter diameter mosaic gifted by South Africa. This intricate design illustrates the routes of Portuguese explorers and the extent of their discoveries, serving as a testament to Portugal's maritime legacy.

Visitors can ascend to the top of the 52-meter-high structure via an elevator or staircase, offering panoramic views of the Tagus River, the Belém district, and nearby landmarks such as the Jerónimos Monastery and the Belém Tower. Inside, the monument houses exhibition spaces that delve into the history of the Portuguese explorations and the cultural context of the Age of Discoveries.

The Padrão dos Descobrimentos not only honors the navigators who expanded the known world but also reflects Portugal's enduring connection to its seafaring past. Its striking design and historical significance make it a must-visit landmark for those exploring Lisbon's rich cultural heritage.
