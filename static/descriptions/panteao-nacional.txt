The Panteão Nacional, originally the Church of Santa Engrácia, is a striking Baroque monument in Lisbon's Alfama district. Construction began in 1682 under architect João Antunes, featuring a Greek cross layout, curved façades, and a vast central dome. Due to prolonged delays, the project wasn't completed until 1966, inspiring the Portuguese expression "obras de Santa Engrácia" for never-ending tasks.

In 1916, the unfinished church was designated as the National Pantheon, honoring notable Portuguese figures. It houses the tombs of presidents, writers, and cultural icons like Amália Rodrigues and Eusébio. Cenotaphs commemorate explorers such as Vasco da Gama and Prince Henry the Navigator.

Today, the Panteão Nacional stands as a symbol of Portugal's rich heritage, blending architectural grandeur with historical significance.
