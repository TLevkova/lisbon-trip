Parque das Nações, or Park of the Nations, is Lisbon’s modern waterfront district, transformed from a former industrial area into a vibrant urban space for Expo '98. The district showcases contemporary architecture, including the Gare do Oriente by Santiago Calatrava and the Portugal Pavilion by Álvaro Siza Vieira. Landmarks such as the Lisbon Oceanarium, Altice Arena, and Vasco da Gama Tower highlight the area's blend of innovation and design.

The Telecabine Lisboa is a 1.2 km cable car ride offering panoramic views of the Tagus River and the district's landmarks. Operating between the Vasco da Gama Tower and the Oceanarium, it provides a unique perspective of the area’s architectural and natural beauty.

Today, Parque das Nações stands as a symbol of Lisbon's forward-looking spirit, offering a harmonious blend of culture, leisure, and modern living along the Tagus waterfront.
