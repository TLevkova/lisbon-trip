Parque Eduardo VII is Lisbon’s largest central park, spanning 26 hectares just north of Avenida da Liberdade. Originally named Parque da Liberdade, it was renamed in 1903 to honor King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, symbolizing the enduring Anglo-Portuguese alliance.

The park's design features a central lawn flanked by symmetrical box hedges and Portuguese mosaic pavements, ascending to a panoramic viewpoint offering sweeping vistas over the city and the Tagus River. This layout was crafted in 1945 by architect Francisco Keil do Amaral, reflecting a blend of modernist and traditional Portuguese landscaping.

A notable attraction within the park is the Estufa Fria, a 1.5-hectare greenhouse complex comprising three sections: the unheated Estufa Fria, the tropical Estufa Quente, and the succulent-focused Estufa Doce. Originally established in a former basalt quarry, these greenhouses house diverse plant species, streams, and waterfalls, creating a serene botanical retreat.

On the eastern side stands the Carlos Lopes Pavilion, initially constructed for the 1922 Rio de Janeiro International Exhibition and relocated to Lisbon in 1929. Adorned with traditional azulejo tiles, it now serves as a venue for cultural events and exhibitions.

At the northern end, the park features a monument commemorating the 25th of April Revolution, a pivotal event in Portugal's transition to democracy. Nearby, the Amália Rodrigues Garden pays tribute to the famed fado singer, offering additional green space for relaxation.

Parque Eduardo VII also hosts the annual Lisbon Book Fair and various cultural events, making it a vibrant hub for both locals and visitors seeking leisure, culture, and panoramic city views.
