Praça do Comércio, also known as Terreiro do Paço, is Lisbon's grandest square and a symbol of the city's resilience and historical significance. Situated along the Tagus River, this expansive plaza was once the site of the Ribeira Palace, the royal residence for over two centuries. The devastating 1755 earthquake destroyed the palace, prompting a comprehensive reconstruction led by the Marquis of Pombal. The square was redesigned in the Pombaline architectural style, characterized by neoclassical buildings with uniform façades and arcades, reflecting Enlightenment ideals of order and rationality.

At the heart of the square stands the equestrian statue of King José I, inaugurated in 1775, symbolizing the monarch's role in the city's recovery. The northern side features the Rua Augusta Arch, a triumphal arch completed in 1873, adorned with allegorical sculptures representing Glory, Valor, and Genius. This monumental gateway connects the square to the city's main pedestrian street, Rua Augusta.

Historically, Praça do Comércio served as the main maritime entrance to Lisbon, where dignitaries and goods arrived via the Tagus River. The square has witnessed significant events, including royal ceremonies and political upheavals, such as the assassination of King Carlos I in 1908. Today, it remains a vibrant public space, hosting cultural events and offering panoramic views of the river, reflecting Lisbon's enduring spirit and rich heritage.
