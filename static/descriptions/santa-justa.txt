The Santa Justa Lift, or Elevador de Santa Justa, is a striking vertical elevator in Lisbon's historic Baixa district, connecting the lower streets with the higher Carmo Square. Designed by engineer Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, a student of Gustave Eiffel, it was inaugurated in 1902 and stands as a testament to early 20th-century engineering.

Constructed entirely of iron, the 45-meter-tall structure showcases intricate Neo-Gothic detailing, featuring ornate arches and geometric patterns. Originally powered by steam and later electrified in 1907, the lift comprises two wooden cabins adorned with polished brass, each accommodating up to 29 passengers.

Beyond its functional role, the Santa Justa Lift offers panoramic views of Lisbon's skyline, including landmarks like the Tagus River and SÃ£o Jorge Castle. As the only vertical lift in the city, it remains a popular attraction, blending practical urban transport with historical and architectural significance.
