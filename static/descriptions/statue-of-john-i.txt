The Statue of King John I stands prominently in Lisbon's Praça da Figueira, honoring the monarch who reigned from 1385 to 1433. King John I, founder of the Aviz dynasty, secured Portugal's independence from Castile during the 1383–1385 Crisis and initiated the Age of Discoveries.

Erected in 1971, this bronze equestrian statue by sculptor Leopoldo de Almeida depicts the king in full armor, holding a scepter while mounted on a horse. The pedestal features medallions of Nuno Álvares Pereira and João das Regras, pivotal figures in the revolution that brought John I to power.

Situated in a bustling square surrounded by cafés and shops, the monument serves as a focal point for both locals and tourists. Its central location makes it an ideal starting point for exploring Lisbon's historic Baixa district.
